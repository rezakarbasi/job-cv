% \item{In this project, we aimed to predict accurate acceleration, velocity, and position values using GPS and an accelerometer. We implemented a \textbf{Kalman Filter} to filter the sensor values and estimate the device's velocity. I used an \textbf{Arduino DUE} to collect the data and applied the filter in \textbf{MATLAB}. This project was the final assignment of the Instrumentation course.}
