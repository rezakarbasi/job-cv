% {Developed a Metatrader trading bot using a technical strategy, enhanced by a \textbf{Deep Q Network} in \textbf{PyTorch}. Leveraged a socket connection for real-time data and analysis of historical data from 2007-2019 in Metatrader. Documented a version on this \rezaLink{https://medium.com/@a.rz.karbasi/enhancing-trading-performance-through-deep-q-network-hyper-parameter-tuning-7475e2f11a06}{Medium blog} and this \rezaLink{https://github.com/rezakarbasi/RL-agent-trader}{Github repo}.}
{Engineered a Metatrader trading bot with a technical strategy, incorporating a \textbf{Deep Q Network} in \textbf{PyTorch}. Utilized a socket connection for data streaming and applied the algorithm on historical data spanning 2007-2019 in Metatrader.

%   \resumeItem{I made a trader bot in \textbf{Metatrader} and set the parameters using the Deep Q network in Python. Metatrader and the RL algorithm were connected by a socket. I published a minor version of the app in this \rezaLink{https://medium.com/@a.rz.karbasi/enhancing-trading-performance-through-deep-q-network-hyper-parameter-tuning-7475e2f11a06}{medium blog} and this \rezaLink{https://github.com/rezakarbasi/RL-agent-trader}{Github repository}. As I described there, I implemented the procedure using socket communication between Metatrader and Python. Besides, there's a multithreading arcitecture in the python app.}
