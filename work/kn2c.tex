    \begin{itemize}
        % \item{Streamlined robot circuitry as an Electronics and Control Engineer with the KN2C Robotic Lab's SSL team, designing, soldering, and maintaining boards with Xmega and ST processors for enhanced motor control. Achieved greater agility and competition performance through precise PID controller calibration.}
        \item{Enhanced robot performance in KN2C's SSL team by designing, soldering, and maintaining Xmega and ST processor boards for motor control and precise \textbf{PID} calibration.}
        \item{Enhanced ball detection accuracy by implementing a \textbf{Kalman Filter} with the Armadillo library in \textbf{C++}.}
        % \item{Crafted a real-time GUI in C\# using Visual Studio for match condition monitoring, facilitating immediate strategic decisions and enhancing team coordination.}
    \end{itemize}

%   \resumeItem{Designer and maintainer of the main boards of our soccer players. The board had an Xmega processor and 4 ST processors to drive motors. We applied higher-level commands (wheel velocities) on each BLDC motor using a PID controller.}
%   \resumeItem{Implementing a \textbf{Kalman Filter} on the estimated position of the ball (based on the camera) to achieve a more stable strategy during gameplay. Besides, I implemented a PID controller on our robot to control the wheel's velocity.}
%   \resumeItem{Developing a GUI to monitor the robots' condition during the game, connected to the main transmitter board to receive data and display essential flags for each player.}
