  \begin{itemize}
    \item {Made a \textbf{CI/CD} pipeline in \textbf{Gitlab} with \textbf{GTest} for the Autosar-based codebase, reducing on-field testing through automated unit and integration tests by 30\%}
    \item {Built a \textbf{PyQT} visualization software for AEB and ACC systems, integrating BEV plots to drastically reduce debugging time. Processed MF4 and CAN signals (BLF, DBC) to expedite vehicle issue diagnosis.}
    \item {Evaluated and integrated advanced path planning solutions, such as lattice-based and \rezaLink{https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo}{Apollo}'s EM planner. Also, developed obstacle avoidance algorithms with \textbf{DP} and \textbf{A*} techniques, validated through a custom Python-based simulator.}
