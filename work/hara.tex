  \begin{itemize}
    \item {Automated audio file categorization by gender and age using Google's \rezaLink{https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/yamnet}{YamNet} (in the TensorFlow framework) as the backbone, fine-tuning the model with the company's labeled data. Developed a custom metric to accurately evaluate classification accuracy, with equal emphasis on precision and recall.}
    \item {Building a filter for detecting operator interruptions and poor voice quality using VAD algorithms.}
    \item {Deployed \textbf{MLflow} to facilitate experiment tracking.}
    \item {Conducted an in-depth assessment and visualization of the company's Speech-to-Text (\textbf{STT}) models under varied real-world conditions (such as noise and reverbation) to pinpoint vulnerabilities.}
  \end{itemize}

  % \resumeItem{As part of my responsibilities at the company, I implemented a network to assign tags to audio files, such as gender, age, sentiment, and satisfaction. Additionally, I developed a filter to detect frequent interruptions by the operator, as well as poor voice quality. }
  % \resumeItem{Assessing the company's STT model in various real-world conditions, such as applying different levels and types of noise to the sound, helped identify its vulnerabilities related to gender, age, and signal quality. This analysis enabled the development of more robust AI-driven solutions for call centers, ultimately improving customer experiences.}
  % \resumeItem{By implementing \textbf{MLflow} workflow, we established a standard for deep learning workflows, enabling us to track experiments, capture experiences, and create referable documents.}
  % \resumeItem{\textbf{Highlights}: STT, VAD, mlflow, linux, tensorflow, Jira, Visualization}
  
  % \resumeItem{Developed an algorithm to automatically tag audio files with attributes such as gender, age, sentiment, and satisfaction, and built a filter for detecting operator interruptions and poor voice quality.}
  % \resumeItem{Conducted in-depth assessments of the company's Speech-to-Text (\textbf{STT}) models under varied real-world conditions to pinpoint and address vulnerabilities, significantly boosting model resilience and customer satisfaction.}
  % \resumeItem{Implemented \textbf{MLflow} to standardize our deep learning workflows, facilitating experiment tracking, knowledge capture, and documentation creation, which streamlined our ML development process.}
