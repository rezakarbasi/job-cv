  \begin{itemize}
    % \item {Automated audio file categorization by gender and age using Google's \rezaLink{https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/yamnet}{YamNet} (in the TensorFlow framework) as the backbone, fine-tuning the model with the company's labeled data. Developed a custom metric to accurately evaluate classification accuracy, with equal emphasis on precision and recall.}
    \item {Leveraged Google's \rezaLink{https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/yamnet}{YamNet} within the \textbf{TensorFlow} framework to automate the categorization of audio files by gender and age, fine-tuning the model on the company's labeled dataset. Introduced a custom loss function that balances precision and recall, achieving an average precision of 0.55 and an average recall of 0.51 across various categories.}
    \item {Building a filter for detecting operator interruptions and poor voice quality using VAD algorithms.}
    % \item {Developed a filter to detect operator interruptions and poor voice quality by employing Voice Activity Detection (VAD) algorithms and conducted feature extraction from voice signals for classification with scikit-learn, achieving an average recall of 0.6 accross the classes.}
    % \item {Engineered an anomaly detection filter for operator interruptions and poor voice quality using Voice Activity Detection (VAD) algorithms. Executed comprehensive data processing and feature extraction from voice signals for classification via scikit-learn, securing an average recall of 0.6 across all classes.}
    \item {Deployed \textbf{MLflow} to facilitate experiment tracking.}
    \item {Conducted an in-depth assessment and visualization of the company's Speech-to-Text (\textbf{STT}) models under varied real-world conditions (such as noise and reverberation) to pinpoint vulnerabilities.}
