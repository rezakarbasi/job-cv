{Our team worked on designing a path planning algorithm for an aerial vehicle to avoid to be collided with obstacles and also remain undetectable from surveillance devices.
In this regard, we made a graph with our knowledge of the obstacles and the formula of detection(having SNR). Then we applied differnt algorithms such as DP, A*, etc to tackle the problem.
Also, we dockerized the project at the end}
