% {Led the team in creating a smarter path planning system for drones, making them better at avoiding obstacles and staying hidden from cameras. By using smart maps and algorithms like \textbf{Dynamic Programming} and \textbf{A*}, we made our system ten times faster at planning safe routes.}
% {Our team developed a path planning algorithm for an aerial vehicle to avoid collisions with obstacles and remain undetectable from surveillance devices.
%  We created a graph using our knowledge of the obstacles and put the weights based on the formula for detection (based on SNR). We then applied various algorithms, such as DP, A*, etc., to address the problem.
%  As the project manager and responsible party, I optimized the older graph-making process \textbf{10 times}.}
%  {Leading a team, we developed a microservice-based platform for a vehicle monitoring, focusing on a graph-based path planning module. By implementing advanced algorithms like Dynamic Programming and A*, we enhanced navigation precision and system responsiveness, achieving a tenfold increase in processing speed over the initial version.}
